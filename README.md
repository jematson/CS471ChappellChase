Created for the course CS471 Senior Capstone

ChappellChase is a sorting algorithm studying game. You play as a hampster escaping a CS professor's basement, using sorting algorithms to put stairs back into a climbable order, ideally the fastest algorithm so as to escape faster. There is also a practice mode to see all the sorting algorithms in action.
